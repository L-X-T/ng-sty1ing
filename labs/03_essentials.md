# 03 CSS Essentials

Open the `lab-03-essentials.html` and `lab-03-essentials.scss`.

## Essentials

1. Create a `<div>` and build a box with it. Demonstrate content (some text), padding, border and margin.
2. If you haven't done so already: Set different values for top, right, bottom, left of the box.
3. If you haven't done so already: Play with the shorthands, e.g. top, side, bottom.
4. Add some more content to the box, maybe a `<input>` and a `<button>`.
5. Add some special styling when you `:focus` into the `<input>` field.
6. Add these styles to your `<input>` { height: 2.5em; padding: 3px 6px }.
7. Does your content still align? May try improving the `vertical-align`.
8. Make the box bigger, set it to a fixed height and a relative width.
9. Change the `background-color` of the box and also the border.
10. Style the content, make sure to use the BEM syntax.

## Bonus: Center experiments

1. Try centering your box, do you know howto?
2. Add another box with another center method.
3. Add a 3rd box with just another method.
